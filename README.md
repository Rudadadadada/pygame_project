## üìå My comment
I did this project in ***2019*** so I want to say that if I were making a game now, I would change a lot in it.
- I would redo the animation logic.
- I don't like the pictures and their number. There are a lot of them, it was possible to use less.
- There is no architecture in the project, everything is done in main.
- I can't use the latest version of python because pygame doesn't work with it. It is sad‚òπÔ∏è

***I uploaded this project because it is part of my programming progress.***
